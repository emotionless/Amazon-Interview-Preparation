### [Why Amazon?](https://www.educative.io/blog/why-amazon-interview-question)
  * Amazon's product that you like most:
  * People's:
  * Values/Missions: I like amazon's LP very much because most of it it matches with me. ...

I want to work at Amazon for three main reasons. First, I admire that Amazon values customer obsession. I believe that putting the customer first leads to better product and software. I am eager to design products that meet real human needs, and I like that Amazon puts that first. For example, I value that AWS is accessible at an enterprise and personal level so that analytics are available to anyone.

Secondly, currently I am working with microservices (You can see in my resume also). Here, I am responsible to provide data for dashboard. I need to provide videos in different qualities. Now storing data and providing them during access is really challanging. I think Amazon also do these things but in more efficient way. Besides amazon has millions of users. In order to serve all of them the system must be scalable system. So there must have several challanges. Thats why I am interested to work in a scalable system.

Lastly, a former co-worker now serves as a Software Engineer at Amazon. He has told me all about the ongoing learning opportunities he had there, and I am eager to engage myself in a workspace that values my learning and development.
